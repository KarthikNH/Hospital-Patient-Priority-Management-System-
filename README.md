# 📌 Hospital Patient Priority Management System

## 📖 Project Description
The **Hospital Patient Priority Management System** is a mini project developed using the **C programming language** as part of the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** course.  
The project simulates a real-world hospital scenario where patients are treated based on the **severity of their condition** using a **priority-based scheduling approach**.

Patients with higher priority (critical condition) are treated first, ensuring efficient emergency handling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand and apply **priority queue concepts**
- To implement **data structures** in a real-world application
- To practice **modular programming in C**
- To implement **file handling** for persistent data storage
- To improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills

---

## 🧩 Data Structures Used
- **Priority Queue (Array-based implementation)**  
  Used to prioritize patients based on severity level.
- **Array**  
  Stores patient records dynamically.
- **File Handling (`patients.txt`)**  
  Used to store and retrieve patient records permanently.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Add new patient details  
- Treat patient with highest priority  
- Display all waiting patients  
- Persistent storage using files  
- Menu-driven and user-friendly interface  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Programming Language: **C**
- Compiler: **GCC**
- Platform: **Linux / Windows**
- File Handling: **Text files**
